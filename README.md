# SimpleNetworkSimulator

A network simulator that utilizes a GUI to show packets flowing in a certain network

This application simulates a network from a given text file. The network is then connected to port localhost:8080 and uses a HTML dom as a GUI.

A certain device can be selected as the sender, another can be selected as the receiver. 
The GUI will then show the flow of packets between both devices through the configured network.

The user can delete/create both connections and devices in-between simulations in order to see how that affects the flow of packets.
